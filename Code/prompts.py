REASONPROMPT = """<USER>: You are a helpful assistant aiming at hateful speech detection. For each message, give the reason why it is hateful. Here are 2 examples:
Example 1:
<USER>: Context 1: The Democrat party is like a dog sniffing its own tail. It stinks.
<ASSISTANT>: Analysis 1: The context is considered hateful because it uses a derogatory comparison to dehumanize a political group (the Democrat party) by likening it to a dog, which implies foolishness or absurdity. Additionally, the phrase 'it stinks' conveys a strong negative judgment, suggesting disdain and contempt. Such language can foster hostility and division, contributing to a culture of hate rather than constructive discourse.
Example 2:
<USER>: Context 2: The working middle class is an easy target! Have fun bleeding us dry with more taxes & Sisyphean social programs, elite upper class robber barons!
<ASSISTANT>: Analysis 2: The context is considered hateful because it employs inflammatory language by labeling the upper class as 'robber barons',which evokes historical connotations of greed and exploitation. This framing dehumanizes individuals within that socioeconomic group and fosters animosity. Additionally, the phrase 'bleeding us dry' expresses a strong sense of victimization and resentment, promoting division between classes rather than encouraging constructive dialogue. Such rhetoric can perpetuate class hatred and animosity.

TRIPLETPROMPT = '''<USER>: You are a helpful assistant skilled in inductive reasoning and summarization. For each message, you will receive an original context and an analysis. Your task is to extract triplets that trigger hate.
In general, the context is more important and the analysis is just for assisting. The output should start with 'Output' and be with the format (head object A, predicate, tail object B) like (King, is, man). Also, there is a special condition that if the two phrase or word co-appear, they will lead to hate, you can use the "co-appear" as the relation and the two phrases or words as the head object and the tail object. Here are two examples:
Example 1:
<USER>: Input 1:  Context: the persecution of christians isn't as bad as the persecution of muslims.
Analysis: The context is considered hateful because it downplays the suffering of one group (Christians) by comparing it to the suffering of another (Muslims). 
This minimizes the severity of the persecution faced by Muslims and can be seen as a form of victim-blaming. 
Furthermore, the implication that Christians are being persecuted is not universally recognized or acknowledged, 
and this statement can be seen as perpetuating a narrative that is divisive and can be hurtful to those who experience persecution.
<ASSISTANT>: Output 1:
(persecution of Christians, is not as bad as, persecution of Muslims),
(comparing to suffering of Muslims, downplays, suffering of Christians)
Example 2:
<USER>: Input 2: Context: just shows how many retarded jerks we have living here buying everything he has. yea, that means your kids you stupid clueless parents. wise up.
Analysis:  The context is considered hateful because it uses derogatory language to insult individuals based on their socioeconomic status (\"retarded jerks\") and their ability to make informed decisions (\"clueless parents\"). 
The use of the word'retarded' is particularly egregious as it's a term that has been historically used to demean people with intellectual disabilities. 
This language is not only hurtful but also discriminatory, perpetuating stigma and hate towards those who may be vulnerable. 
The final sentence, \"wise up,\" is a condescending and aggressive statement that further escalates the hate speech.
<ASSISTANT>: Output 2:
(retarded, co-appear, jerk),
(derogatory language, insults, individuals),
(wise up, is condescending, aggressive statement)
<USER>: New Input: {context}
<ASSISTANT>: Output:'''


FILTERPROMPT = """<USER>: Please select the triplet evoking the hate from the following triplets began with 'Input:' and within the []. In general, the triplet should be in form like (Object A, relation, Object B), where A is a noun phrase or word, relation is a predicate(verb or a linking verb).If the input triplets don't fit the format, you should rewrite the input triplets first.
The number of triplet is not fixed, can be one or several, you are required to select all hate triggered triplets. Finally, output the hate triggered triplets in [] only.
Here are two examples:
Example 1:
<USER>: Input 1: [(downplays suffering of Christians, by comparing to, suffering of Muslims),(persecution of Christians, is not as bad as, persecution of Muslims),(minimizes severity of persecution, faced by, Muslims),(implication that Christians are being persecuted, is not universally recognized, acknowledgment)]
